# Employee Attrition Prediction 

This project applies multiple machine learning models to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company or not), using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.

## Dataset
- Name: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
- Rows: 1,470
- Features: 35 (categorical + numerical)
- Target: `Attrition` (Yes/No)

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Linear Regression (for comparison)

## Evaluation
- Models evaluated using `F1-Score` for class 1 (resigned employees)
- Data split: 80% training / 20% testing
- Results visualized using confusion matrices and bar plots
